******** STARTING SMALL EXPERIMENT ********
A graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges was generated.

10 of topology change
=====================
2 edges deleted
Affection rate: 9/90 = 10.00%

Using SECOND BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 9/9 = 100.00%
Using WORST BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 9/9 = 100.00%

30 of topology change
=====================
5 edges deleted
Affection rate: 20/90 = 22.22%

Using SECOND BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 16/20 = 80.00%
Using WORST BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 6/20 = 30.00%

50 of topology change
=====================
8 edges deleted
Affection rate: 43/90 = 47.78%

Using SECOND BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 23/43 = 53.49%
Using WORST BEST COST backup strategy...   Fail rate: 23/43 = 53.49%
