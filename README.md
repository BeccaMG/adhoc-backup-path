######Abstract
One of the main challenges in adhoc networks nowadays is to deal with the constant altering of the topology. In such networks, the coverage and location of the nodes are frequently changing due to their inherent mobility. These modifications cause unreliability in the links as well as regular failures which lead to a degraded QoS. Although this is a major challenge and there are many different routing protocols, most of them focus on finding end-to-end paths without computing a resilient one in case of outages. In this paper, a simple graph algorithm is proposed to act as a backup strategy built on a simulated routing protocol ... \*TO BE COMPLETED WITH THE CHOSEN METRICS TO DECIDE THE BACKUP PATH\* ... A PoC was conducted to observe the effect of integrating the proposed algorithm into the chosen routing protocol, focusing on the performance results of each metric and the advantageousness of adding the backup aproach on a real implementation.
